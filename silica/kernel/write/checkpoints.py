"""Per-note checkpoint stack — durable undo for interactive patches.

Every successful interactive patch (silica_patch_note) pushes the resulting
note content onto a per-path stack. ``/undo`` pops the top and restores the
note to the new top, walking back one patch at a time. The very first push for
a note also seeds the *original* (pre-patch) content as the immovable floor, so
a chain of undos returns the note to exactly how it was before Silica touched it.

This is deliberately separate from the FSM's transactional snapshot/rollback
(silica_snapshot / silica_restore): that protects a whole pipeline run and is
discarded on success, whereas this is a lightweight, user-facing edit history
for single notes that survives across REPL sessions.

Storage: ~/.silica/checkpoints.db (SQLite), one row per restore point, ordered
by autoincrement id. Keyed by vault-relative path.
