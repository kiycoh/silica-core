"""Centralized language resolution — single source of truth.

Multiple kernel modules (cooccurrence, overlay, keyphrase, cohesion,
prep_delegation) each grew their own copy of language-name mapping,
stopword loading and function-word detection, reaching into each other's
private module state to do it. This module reifies that logic into one
leaf: it imports NO other silica module, does zero LLM work, is fully
offline and deterministic, and never raises — every function degrades to
a usable value on failure.
