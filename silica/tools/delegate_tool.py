"""silica_delegate — fan a list of worker tasks out through the capability seam.

Each task becomes a WorkItem (kind = profile name) dispatched by
``run_subagent_batch``: the same registry, dispatch, and consumer loop used for
every other background behaviour. Concurrency is bounded by the pool size (cap
10, the historical fan-out limit) plus the global worker semaphore inside
run_worker. Returns aggregated results in submission order plus a status
summary.
